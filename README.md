# checkers

a simple game of checkers I made using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
I made this project to show off in my portfolio.

I did not make the images here, I found them on google images.

I have majorly refactored the code, it is now much more readable, much more compact, and much, much less redundant.
