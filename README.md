# checkers

a simple game of checkers I made using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
I made this project to show off in my portfolio.

I did not make the images here, I found them on google images.

I have majorly refactored the code, it is now much more readable, much more compact, and much, much less redundant.

### TODO:
>Jumping

I want jumps to be optional, unless it's a successive jump. I also want successive jumps to be allowed up to and including every single piece (if possible).

>Checker movement

At the moment you can move any piece anywhere at any time. I'm going to change that so only the player whos turn it is can make a move.

>Points

Eventually each piece jumped will award points to the jumper.

>End Game Screen

Nothing happens when the game ends right now. I'll need to make a pop up screen similar to the screen on my memory game that verifies the winner and asks the user if they'd like to play again.
